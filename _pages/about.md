# <b style="color: #15797d"> About me </b> 

<b style="color: #580d5e">Â¡Hola! </b>  Welcome to my personal website. 

I am currently living in Lyon, France; working on a project that focuses on the cognitive and neural correlates of memory maintenance mechanisms. Specifically investigating the strategies that we use when we apply attentional refreshing to maintain information in working memory.

## <b style="color:#580d5e">It's all about cognition and the building blocks of learning...</b> 

My research interests and background also cover other different topics in developmental cognitive psychology including: academic achievement, executive functions, and numerical cognition; with both behavioural and neuroimaging methods, in different age groups. 


What I have enjoyed most about my research trajectory is that it has allowed me to work and live in Mexico (where I am from), the UK, and France. Needless to say that, eventhought it has been a great challenge, this has provided me with different tools usefull for research and life in general.
