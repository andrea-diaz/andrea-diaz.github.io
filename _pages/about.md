## Academic profile 

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the
[Laboratoire d'Etude des MÃ©canismes Cognitifs](https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr/), in Lyon, France. Our project focuses on the cognitive and neural correlates of memory maintenance mechanisms.

My research interests and background cover different topics in developmental cognitive psychology including: academic achievement, executive functions, and numerical cognition; with both behavioural and neuroimaging methods, in different age groups. 

What I have enjoyed most about my research trajectory is that it has allowed me to work and live in Mexico (where I am from), the UK, and France. Needless to say that eventhought it has been a great challenge, this has provided me with different tools usefull for research and life in general.
