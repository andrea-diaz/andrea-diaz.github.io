## My academic profile

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the
[Laboratoire d'Etude des MÃ©canismes Cognitifs](https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr/), in Lyon, France. Our project focuses on the cognitive and neural correlates of memory maintenance mechanisms.

My interests and knowledge reside across a range of developmental cognitive psychology topics including academic achievement, executive functions, and numerical cognition, with both behavioural and neuroimaging methods, across different age groups. My path in research has allowed me to work and live in Mexico (where I am from), United Kingdom, and France.
