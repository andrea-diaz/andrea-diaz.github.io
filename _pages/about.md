## A little bit about my research journey. . .

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the
[Laboratoire d'Etude des Mécanismes Cognitifs](https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr/), in Lyon, France. Our current project focuses on the cognitive and neural correlates of memory maintenance mechanisms. Specifically, what strategies do we use when we apply attentional refreshing to maintain information in working memory.

My research interests and background also cover other different topics in developmental cognitive psychology including: academic achievement, executive functions, and numerical cognition; with both behavioural and neuroimaging methods, in different age groups. 

At first glance it may seem that I have been involved in projects that are unrelated to each other...but they are related! It's all about cognition and the processes behind our learning abilities. 

What I have enjoyed most about my research trajectory is that it has allowed me to work and live in Mexico (where I am from), the UK, and France. Needless to say that, eventhought it has been a great challenge, this has provided me with different tools usefull for research and life in general.
