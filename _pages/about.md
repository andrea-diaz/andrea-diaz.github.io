## My academic profile

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the
[Laboratoire d'Etude des MÃ©canismes Cognitifs](https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr/), in Lyon, France. 

My interests and knowledge reside across a range of developmental cognitive psychology topics including academic achievement, executive functions, and numerical cognition, with both behavioural and neuroimaging methods, across different age groups.
