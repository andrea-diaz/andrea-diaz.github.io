# <b style="color: #15797d"> About me </b> 

<b style="color: #580d5e">¡Hola! </b>  Welcome to my personal website. 

I am a researcher in cognitive neuropsychology currently living in Montreal, Canada.
I am a person driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for acquiring knowledge.

## <b style="color:#580d5e">It's all about cognition and the building blocks of learning...</b> 

My research interests and background allows me to dive deep into different topics in developmental cognitive psychology including: academic achievement, executive functions, and numerical cognition; with both behavioural and neuroimaging methods, in different age groups. 

I really enjoy uncovering new information and understanding complex concepts, constantly questioning what I know, or rather, what I think I know.

What I have enjoyed most about my research trajectory is that it has allowed me to work and live in Mexico (where I am from), the UK, France, and very recently, Canada! Needless to say that, even though it has been a great challenge, this has provided me with different tools useful for research and life in general.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am deeply committed to using my skills and knowledge to help others. Whether it’s through mentoring, sharing insights, or collaborating on projects, I strive to make a positive impact and contribute to the growth and success of those around me. My goal is to blend my love for learning with a genuine desire to support and uplift others, creating a ripple effect of knowledge and kindness in the world.
